# Asian_Kitchen_with_JS

## In this homework, I created an Asian Kitchen's Menu web page with javascript.

* Content on the site is defined in JavaScript as objects in a menu-shaped array.

* There are id, title, category, price, img and desc sections.

* Buttons also came from js file.

* Methods such as map and reduce were used in the site.
